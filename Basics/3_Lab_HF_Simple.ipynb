      "An **MCP server** (Multi-Channel Protocol server) is a tool that helps **voice chat applications** (like Discord, Teamspeak, or Mumble) work together with **Minecraft**, allowing players to talk in real-time while playing the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **How it works in simple terms:**\n",
      "- Normally, Minecraft has its own basic voice chat system, but it’s limited (e.g., only nearby players can hear each other).\n",
      "- An MCP server acts as a **middleman**, forwarding voice data from your chat app to Minecraft (and vice versa).\n",
      "- This way, you can use **high-quality voice chat** (with better sound, effects, or features) while still hearing Minecraft’s sounds (like explosions, footsteps, or mob noises).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Example:**\n",
      "Imagine you’re playing Minecraft with friends on a server, and you want to use **Discord** for better voice quality and fun voice effects (like echo or robot voices).\n",

      "**MCP** stands for **\"Most Common Path\"**—it’s a simple way to describe the **easiest or most typical route** someone takes to achieve a goal, solve a problem, or complete a task.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Why does MCP matter?**\n",
      "In real life, people often follow the same steps (or \"path\") to do something because it’s the most straightforward or well-known method. If you want to improve a process, you can:\n",
      "1. **Make the MCP better** (e.g., faster, easier, or more efficient).\n",
