      "An **MCP server** (Multi-Channel Protocol server) is a tool that helps **voice chat applications** (like Discord, Teamspeak, or Mumble) work together with **Minecraft**, allowing players to talk in real-time while playing the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **How it works in simple terms:**\n",
      "- Normally, Minecraft has its own basic voice chat system, but it’s limited (e.g., only nearby players can hear each other).\n",
      "- An MCP server acts as a **middleman**, forwarding voice data from your chat app to Minecraft (and vice versa).\n",
      "- This way, you can use **high-quality voice chat** (with better sound, effects, or features) while still hearing Minecraft’s sounds (like explosions, footsteps, or mob noises).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Example:**\n",
      "Imagine you’re playing Minecraft with friends on a server, and you want to use **Discord** for better voice quality and fun voice effects (like echo or robot voices).\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You\n"
