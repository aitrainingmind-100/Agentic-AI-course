      "- Mean (average) distance: about 384,400 km (238,855 miles).  \n",
      "- Typical closest (perigee): about 363,300 km (225,623 miles).  \n",

      "Model: In short: Antarctica is colder because it’s a high, dry landmass isolated from warm ocean heat, while the Arctic is a relatively low, sea‑ice covered ocean surrounded by continents that supply heat. Main reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Elevation: Antarctica is a continent with an average elevation ≈ 2,300 m (ice sheet up to ~4 km thick). Temperature falls with altitude, so the high Antarctic interior is much colder than sea level Arctic air.  \n",
      "- Surface type and heat capacity: The Arctic is mostly ocean covered by seasonal sea ice. Water stores and transports heat and moderates temperature. Antarctica is thick ice over land, which cannot store and release as much heat.  \n",
      "- Oceanic isolation: The Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Southern Ocean limit north–south exchange of warm water, reducing heat delivered to the continent.  \n",
      "- Atmospheric isolation and strong polar vortex: Strong circumpolar winds and a strong Southern Hemisphere polar vortex isolate Antarctic air, reducing heat transport from lower latitudes.  \n",
      "- Dryness and greenhouse effect: Antarctic air is very dry (low water‑vapor), so there is less greenhouse warming; dry air also radiates heat away more efficiently.  \n",
      "- Geographic configuration: The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by relatively warm landmasses and ocean currents (e.g., Atlantic inflow) that bring heat poleward; Antarctica is a landmass surrounded by ocean, the opposite geometry.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors combine so the Antarctic interior reaches much lower temperatures than the Arctic; for example, the coldest measured surface temperature on Earth (~−89°C at Vostok) occurs in Antarctica. \n",
