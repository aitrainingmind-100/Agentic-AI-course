      " Step 1 — a simple definition\n",
      "- Probability is a number that measures how likely something is to happen.  \n",
      "- It always lies between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%). 0 means impossible, 1 means certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2 — basic words\n",
      "- Sample space: the list of all possible outcomes (call it S).  \n",
      "- Event: something that might happen (a subset of S).  \n",
      "- Probability of an event A: written P(A).\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3 — rule for equally likely outcomes (classical rule)\n",
      "- If every outcome in S is equally likely, P(A) = (number of outcomes in A) ÷ (number of outcomes in S).\n",
      "- Example: flipping one fair coin.\n",
      "  1. S = {Heads, Tails} so |S| = 2.\n",
      "  2. Event A = “get Heads” has |A| = 1.\n",
      "  3. P(Heads) = 1 ÷ 2 = 1/2 = 0.5 (50%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4 — more examples, step-by-step\n",
      "- Rolling one fair six-sided die, probability of a 4:\n",
      "  1. S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, so |S| = 6.\n",
      "  2. A = {4}, so |A| = 1.\n",
      "  3. P(4) = 1 ÷ 6 ≈ 0.1667.\n",
      "- Drawing an ace from a 52-card deck:\n",
      "  1. |S| = 52.\n",
      "  2. A = the 4 aces, so |A| = 4.\n",
      "  3. P(ace) = 4 ÷ 52 = 1/13 ≈ 0.0769.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5 — some important rules (with brief examples)\n",
      "- Complement: P(not A) = 1 − P(A).\n",
      "  Example: not rolling a 4 = 1 − 1/6 = 5/6.\n",
      "- Addition for mutually exclusive events: if A and B cannot both happen, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).\n",
      "  Example: rolling 1 or 2 on a die: P = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n",
      "- General addition rule: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B).\n",
      "  Example: drawing a card that is a heart or an ace:\n",
      "   1. P(heart) = 13/52 = 1/4.\n",
      "   2. P(ace) = 4/52 = 1/13.\n",
      "   3. Overlap P(ace of hearts) = 1/52.\n",
      "   4. P(heart or ace) = 1/4 + 1/13 − 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13.\n",
      "- Independence: if A and B do not affect each other, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B).\n",
      "  Example: two independent fair coin flips, both heads: 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4.\n",
      "- Conditional probability: probability of A given B has happened: P(A | B) = P(A and B) ÷ P(B).\n",
      "  Example: drawing two cards without replacement — probability the second card is an ace given the first was an ace:\n",
      "   1. After first ace is removed, 51 cards remain and 3 aces remain.\n",
      "   2. So P(second is ace | first was ace) = 3 ÷ 51 = 1/17.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6 — other ways to think about probability\n",
      "- Empirical (frequentist): probability ≈ long-run fraction of times the event happens if you repeat the experiment many times.\n",
      "- Subjective: probability is a personal degree of belief based on available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 7 — quick summary of key facts\n",
      "- Probabilities are between 0 and 1.  \n",
      "- Sum of probabilities of all outcomes in S = 1.  \n",
      "- Use counting for equally likely cases, formulas for combinations, and conditional/independence rules when events interact.\n",
